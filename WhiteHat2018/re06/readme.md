You can open it in dnspy, copy their enc() function out and bruteforce + guessing the flag based on hard-coded enc(flag). Just put in different input, debug and see the enc(input), you will understand what i am talking about.

There was another way to solve it, but i use this way to solve because it's easiest and wanna be first team solve it (though i end up solved it as 6th team, if i remember it right lol)

Here is the code i used to bruteforce + handy solve this challenge
