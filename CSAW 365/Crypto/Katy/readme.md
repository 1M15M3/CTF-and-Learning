We gonna take a look at program in main() :

Take a look at hash():

After that, i realise... We dont need to care about hash() because what we need to do is find the seed after generated by hash(). Also it seems that this challenge is broken. When i said other write ups, they said that we need to find char flag by break the hash() but since it's impossible, so the organize decided we just need to find the seed after hash()

Let's take a look at next_cypher() :

Got the idea!? : It's just generate new seed base on last seed, so go and connect to the server and get a seed (we need to enter 15 times and so on lol)

Ok now we hash 2 seed value, 1364650861 and 1208101748. We know that 1208101748 is created base on 1364650861, let say we dont know that, i wrote a script to bruteforce to find 1364650861 :

It works! So our job is to find the seed that be used to generate 1364650861 :
